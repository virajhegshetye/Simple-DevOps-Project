For your **hackathon demo**, you're implementing a **voice-based quotation management bot** using **Microsoft Copilot Studio** to simplify the setup and address the microphone issue encountered with the previous custom solution. In the previous response, Step 2 outlined how to design the conversational flow in Copilot Studio to replicate your bot's functionality (collecting first name, last name, monthly income, confirming input, and providing a mock API response like "accept," "decline," or "refer"). You’ve now asked for a detailed explanation of **Step 2: Design the Conversational Flow**, specifically focusing on where the options are present in the Copilot Studio menu and how to navigate them. Since you're using the **Azure Portal** (UI-based, no CLI), avoiding certificate management, and preparing for a hackathon, I'll provide a detailed, beginner-friendly guide in **Markdown format** to walk you through the Copilot Studio interface, menu navigation, and the specific options for designing the conversational flow.

# Detailed Explanation of Step 2: Design the Conversational Flow in Microsoft Copilot Studio

## Overview
In **Microsoft Copilot Studio**, the conversational flow is designed using **topics**, which are modular conversation paths triggered by user inputs (e.g., phrases or voice commands). Your goal is to create a topic named `QuotationFlow` that replicates the bot's functionality: asking for the user's first name, last name, monthly income, confirming the details, and providing a mock API response. Copilot Studio's interface is web-based, accessible via [copilotstudio.microsoft.com](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com), and uses a no-code graphical canvas to build these flows. I'll guide you through the menu navigation, where each option is located, and how to configure the flow step-by-step.

---

## Prerequisites
- **Copilot Studio Agent Created**: From Step 1 of the previous solution, you’ve created a voice-enabled agent named `QuotationBot` using the **Voice** template.
- **Access to Copilot Studio**: You're logged into [copilotstudio.microsoft.com](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com) with a Microsoft 365 account (or trial).
- **Voice Features Enabled**: The agent is optimized for voice under **Settings** > **General** > **Optimize for voice** (default for Voice template).
- **Goal**: Design the `QuotationFlow` topic to handle the conversational flow for your hackathon demo.

---

## Step 2: Design the Conversational Flow - Detailed Menu Navigation

### 1. Navigate to the Topics Section
1. **Open Copilot Studio**:
   - Log in to [copilotstudio.microsoft.com](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com) with your Microsoft 365 account.
   - On the **Home** page, under **Recent agents**, click on your agent (`QuotationBot`).

2. **Access the Topics Menu**:
   - Once inside the `QuotationBot` agent, look at the left-hand sidebar.
   - The sidebar contains the main navigation menu with icons and labels.
   - Find the **Topics** option (typically the second or third item in the sidebar, represented by a chat bubble or list icon).
   - Click **Topics** to enter the topics management area.
   - This page displays a list of existing topics (e.g., default topics like "Greeting", "Escalate", "End of conversation").

3. **Understand the Topics Interface**:
   - The **Topics** page shows a table with columns: **Name**, **Trigger phrases**, **Status**, and **Actions**.
   - Each topic defines a conversation path that the agent can follow when triggered by user input.

---

### 2. Create a Custom Topic (`QuotationFlow`)
1. **Add a New Topic**:
   - On the **Topics** page, look at the top-right corner of the table.
   - Find the **New topic** button (a blue button with a "+" icon or labeled "New topic").
   - Click **New topic** to create a new topic.
   - A new topic editor opens with a blank canvas and a default name (e.g., "Topic-1").

2. **Rename the Topic**:
   - In the topic editor, at the top of the page, you’ll see the topic name field (e.g., "Topic-1").
   - Click on the name to edit it.
   - Enter `QuotationFlow` as the topic name.
   - Press **Enter** or click outside the field to save the name.

3. **Set Trigger Phrases**:
   - Below the topic name, find the **Trigger phrases** section (a text area with a placeholder like "Add a phrase").
   - Trigger phrases are user inputs (text or voice) that activate this topic.
   - Click **Add a phrase** and enter phrases like:
     - "start quotation"
     - "get a quote"
     - "apply for a card"
   - Press **Enter** after each phrase to add it to the list.
   - These phrases ensure the topic is triggered when users say something like "start quotation" (via voice or text).

4. **Save the Topic**:
   - At the top-right corner of the topic editor, click **Save** (a floppy disk icon or "Save" button) to save the topic.

---

### 3. Add Nodes for the Conversational Flow
The topic editor uses a **canvas** to build the conversational flow by adding **nodes** (e.g., Message, Question, Condition). Each node represents a step in the conversation (e.g., asking a question, sending a message). The canvas starts with a **Trigger phrases** node, and you’ll add subsequent nodes below it.

#### 3.1. Add a Welcome Message
1. **Add a Message Node**:
   - Below the **Trigger phrases** node on the canvas, click the **+** icon (a plus sign in a circle) to add a new node.
   - A dropdown menu appears with node types: **Message**, **Question**, **Condition**, **Action**, etc.
   - Select **Message** from the dropdown.
   - A **Message** node appears on the canvas.

2. **Configure the Message**:
   - In the **Message** node, there’s a text area labeled "Enter your message".
   - Type: `Hello! Please tell me your first name.`
   - This message will be spoken aloud (via Text-to-Speech) when the topic is triggered.

3. **Save the Node**:
   - Click outside the text area or press **Enter** to save the message.
   - The node will display the message text on the canvas.

#### 3.2. Collect First Name
1. **Add a Question Node**:
   - Below the **Message** node, click the **+** icon to add another node.
   - From the dropdown, select **Question**.
   - A **Question** node appears with fields to configure.

2. **Configure the Question**:
   - **Question Text**: In the text area labeled "Ask a question", type: `What is your first name?`
   - **Variable**: Below the question text, find the **Save response as** field.
     - This field lets you store the user’s response in a variable.
     - Click the dropdown or type a variable name: `FirstName`.
     - Ensure the variable type is set to **String** (default for text input).
   - **Input Options**: Below the variable field, find the **Input options** section.
     - Ensure **Speech & DTMF** is enabled (default for a voice-enabled agent). This allows voice input (Speech-to-Text) and DTMF (keypad) input.
     - Optionally, you can disable DTMF if you only want voice input by toggling off the DTMF option.

3. **Save the Node**:
   - Click outside the fields to save the configuration.
   - The node will display the question and variable name (e.g., "What is your first name? (FirstName)").

#### 3.3. Collect Last Name
1. **Add a Message Node**:
   - Below the **Question** node, click the **+** icon.
   - Select **Message**.
   - In the text area, type: `Got it, {FirstName}. Now, please tell me your last name.`
     - The `{FirstName}` syntax uses the variable from the previous step to personalize the message.

2. **Add a Question Node**:
   - Below the **Message** node, click the **+** icon.
   - Select **Question**.
   - **Question Text**: `What is your last name?`
   - **Save response as**: `LastName` (type: String).
   - **Input Options**: Ensure **Speech & DTMF** is enabled.

#### 3.4. Collect Monthly Income
1. **Add a Message Node**:
   - Below the **LastName** question node, click the **+** icon.
   - Select **Message**.
   - Type: `Thanks, {LastName}. What is your monthly income?`

2. **Add a Question Node**:
   - Below the **Message** node, click the **+** icon.
   - Select **Question**.
   - **Question Text**: `What is your monthly income?`
   - **Save response as**: `MonthlyIncome`.
     - Set the variable type to **Number** (click the type dropdown and select Number to handle numeric input like "5000").
   - **Input Options**: Ensure **Speech & DTMF** is enabled.

#### 3.5. Confirmation
1. **Add a Message Node**:
   - Below the **MonthlyIncome** question node, click the **+** icon.
   - Select **Message**.
   - Type: `Please confirm: First Name: {FirstName}, Last Name: {LastName}, Monthly Income: ${MonthlyIncome}. Say "yes" to confirm or "no" to restart.`
     - Use `{FirstName}` and `{LastName}` for variables, and `${MonthlyIncome}` for the number variable (Copilot Studio syntax for numbers).

2. **Add a Question Node**:
   - Below the **Message** node, click the **+** icon.
   - Select **Question**.
   - **Question Text**: `Do you confirm?`
   - **Save response as**: `Confirmation` (type: String).
   - **Input Options**: Ensure **Speech & DTMF** is enabled.

3. **Add a Condition Node**:
   - Below the **Confirmation** question node, click the **+** icon.
   - Select **Condition**.
   - A **Condition** node appears with two branches: **If** and **Else**.
   - **Configure the Condition**:
     - In the **If** branch, set the condition:
       - Variable: `Confirmation`.
       - Operator: **equals**.
       - Value: `yes`.
     - This checks if the user said "yes".
   - **If Branch (Yes)**:
     - Below the **If** branch, click the **+** icon.
     - Proceed to the mock API response (next step).
   - **Else Branch (No or Other)**:
     - Below the **Else** branch, click the **+** icon.
     - Select **Message**.
     - Type: `Let’s start over. Please tell me your first name.`
     - Add a **Redirect to another topic** node:
       - Click the **+** icon below the message.
       - Select **Topic management** > **Redirect to another topic**.
       - Choose the `QuotationFlow` topic to loop back to the start.

#### 3.6. Mock API Response
1. **Add a Message Node for Mock Response**:
   - In the **If** branch of the condition (when `Confirmation` is "yes"), click the **+** icon.
   - Select **Message**.
   - Type: `Your application has been accepted for a card. Thank you!`
     - For simplicity, use a static response ("accepted") for the hackathon demo.
     - **Optional Random Response (Advanced)**:
       - To simulate a random response ("accept", "decline", "refer"), you’d need a **Power Automate** flow:
         - Add an **Action** node instead of a Message node.
         - Select **Create a flow** to open Power Automate.
         - In Power Automate, create a flow that returns a random string ("accept", "decline", "refer") using a variable and the `rand()` function.
         - Return the result to Copilot Studio and use it in a **Message** node: `Your application has been {FlowResult}ed for a card. Thank you!`
       - For a hackathon, a static response is sufficient unless you have time to set up the flow.

#### 3.7. End Conversation
1. **Add an End Conversation Node**:
   - Below the mock response **Message** node, click the **+** icon.
   - Select **Topic management** > **End conversation**.
   - This ends the conversation, simulating the end of a call.

2. **Save the Topic**:
   - At the top-right corner, click **Save** to save the entire topic.

---

### 4. Test the Conversational Flow
1. **Access the Test Panel**:
   - At the top-right corner of the Copilot Studio interface, find the **Test your agent** button (a chat bubble icon or "Test your agent" label).
   - Click **Test your agent** to open the test panel on the right side of the screen.

2. **Enable Speech Mode**:
   - In the test panel, look for the input mode options at the top.
   - Find the **Speech & DTMF** toggle (a microphone icon or labeled "Speech & DTMF").
   - Enable **Speech & DTMF** mode to test voice interactions.
   - This uses Azure Speech Services for Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech.

3. **Start the Test**:
   - Click the microphone icon in the test panel to start speaking.
   - Say a trigger phrase (e.g., "start quotation").
   - The agent should respond with: "Hello! Please tell me your first name."
   - Speak responses (e.g., "John", "Doe", "5000", "yes").
   - Verify the flow:
     - Personalized prompts (e.g., "Got it, John...").
     - Confirmation message with variables.
     - Mock response ("Your application has been accepted...").
     - Conversation ends.

4. **Debug Issues**:
   - If voice input fails, check the test panel for errors (e.g., "Speech not recognized").
   - Ensure microphone permissions are granted (padlock icon > **Site settings** > **Microphone** > **Allow**).
   - If variables aren’t working (e.g., `{FirstName}` shows as text), ensure they’re correctly set in the **Question** nodes.

---

### 5. Additional Configuration (Optional)
1. **Customize Voice Output**:
   - In the **Message** nodes, click the **Advanced options** (gear icon or "More options").
   - Use **SSML** (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) to customize voice output:
     - Example for the welcome message:
       ```xml
       <speak version="1.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis">
         <voice name="en-US-JennyNeural">
           Hello! Please tell me your first name.
         </voice>
       </speak>
       ```
     - This uses the "Jenny" neural voice for a human-like tone.
   - You can select different voices or adjust pitch/speed via SSML.

2. **Handle Errors**:
   - Add a fallback topic for unrecognized inputs:
     - Go to **Topics** > **System topics** > **Fallback**.
     - Add a **Message** node: "Sorry, I didn’t understand. Please say 'start quotation' to begin."
     - Redirect to `QuotationFlow`.

3. **Localization**:
   - If your demo audience speaks another language, go to **Settings** > **Languages** and add a secondary language (e.g., Spanish).
   - Translate the `QuotationFlow` messages for that language.

## Additional Notes
- **Microphone Issue**: Testing in Copilot Studio’s **Test your agent** panel can confirm if the microphone issue persists. If it works here but not in the embedded web app (Step 3), the issue may be with the iframe or browser security settings.
- **No ACS Phone Number**: The flow is designed for browser/mobile voice interactions, avoiding telephony.
- **Hackathon Appeal**: Highlight the no-code setup and voice interaction in your demo.
- **Time-Saving**: Copilot Studio reduces coding effort compared to the Node.js solution, allowing more focus on demo polish.

---

## Next Steps
After designing the flow, proceed to **Step 3: Publish and Embed the Agent in a Web App** from the previous solution to create a browser/mobile demo. If the microphone issue persists in the test panel, share browser console errors (F12 > Console), and I’ll provide further troubleshooting for your hackathon demo!


For your **hackathon demo**, you’re building a **voice-based quotation management bot** using **Microsoft Copilot Studio** to handle the conversational flow (collecting first name, last name, monthly income, confirming input, and providing a mock API response like "accepted"). In the previous steps, you created a voice-enabled agent (`QuotationBot`) and designed the conversational flow in a topic named `QuotationFlow`. Now, in **Step 3: Publish and Embed the Agent in a Web App**, you’ll publish the agent in Copilot Studio and embed it into a web app to enable browser/mobile voice interactions, simulating telephony without an **Azure Communication Services (ACS)** phone number. This approach uses the **Azure Portal** (UI-based, no CLI), avoids certificate management, and leverages **Ngrok** for external access, ensuring a demo-ready setup for your hackathon. Since you’re facing a microphone issue, I’ll also include tips to troubleshoot it during this step. Below is a detailed, beginner-friendly guide in **Markdown format** to walk you through the process.

# Step 3: Publish and Embed the Agent in a Web App

## Overview
In this step, you’ll **publish** your Copilot Studio agent (`QuotationBot`) to make it available for use and then **embed** it into a custom web app (`index.html`) for browser/mobile access. The embedded agent will support voice interactions using Copilot Studio’s **Speech & DTMF modality**, allowing users to interact via microphone and hear voice responses (via Azure Speech Services). You’ll serve the web app locally using `http-server` and expose it externally with Ngrok, ensuring HTTPS access without certificate management. This setup enables you to demo the voice-based conversational flow (e.g., "John", "Doe", "5000", "yes") in a browser or mobile device, ideal for your hackathon presentation.

---

## Prerequisites
- **Copilot Studio Agent**: You’ve created the `QuotationBot` agent (Step 1) and designed the `QuotationFlow` topic (Step 2) in Copilot Studio ([copilotstudio.microsoft.com](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com)).
- **Conversational Flow Tested**: The flow works in Copilot Studio’s **Test your agent** panel, responding to voice inputs (e.g., "start quotation", "John", "Doe", "5000", "yes") with voice outputs.
- **Tools Installed**:
  - **http-server**: Installed globally (`npm install -g http-server`) to serve the web app locally.
  - **Ngrok**: Installed and ready to expose the web app externally.
- **Browser/Mobile Device**: Chrome or Edge with microphone access for testing.
- **Web App Folder**: A `webapp` folder exists from previous steps, where you’ll create `index.html`.

---

## Step 3: Publish and Embed the Agent in a Web App - Detailed Steps

### 1. Publish the Agent in Copilot Studio
Publishing makes your agent live and accessible for embedding in channels like a web app.

1. **Open Copilot Studio**:
   - Log in to [copilotstudio.microsoft.com](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com) with your Microsoft 365 account.
   - On the **Home** page, under **Recent agents**, click on your agent (`QuotationBot`).

2. **Navigate to the Publish Section**:
   - Look at the left-hand sidebar for the main navigation menu.
   - Find the **Publish** option (typically near the bottom, represented by an upward arrow or "Publish" label).
   - Click **Publish** to enter the publishing area.
   - Alternatively, if you’re in the topic editor (e.g., `QuotationFlow`), look at the top-right corner of the interface for a **Publish** button (an upward arrow or "Publish" label).

3. **Publish the Agent**:
   - On the **Publish** page, you’ll see a message like "Publish your agent to make the latest changes available to your users."
   - Click the **Publish** button (a blue button labeled "Publish").
   - A confirmation dialog may appear (e.g., "Are you sure you want to publish?").
   - Confirm by clicking **Publish** again.
   - Wait for the publishing process to complete (takes 1-2 minutes).
   - Once done, you’ll see a success message like "Successfully published."

4. **Verify Publish Status**:
   - The **Publish** page may show the last published date/time (e.g., "Last published: June 05, 2025, 01:40 AM IST").
   - Ensure this timestamp matches your latest changes to confirm the agent is up-to-date.

---

### 2. Configure the Web App Channel
To embed the agent in a web app, you need to enable the **Web app** channel in Copilot Studio and obtain the embed code (HTML snippet).

1. **Navigate to Channels**:
   - In the left-hand sidebar, find the **Channels** option (represented by a plug icon or "Channels" label).
   - Click **Channels** to enter the channels management area.
   - The **Channels** page displays a list of available channels (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Web app, Custom).

2. **Select Web App Channel**:
   - In the list of channels, find **Web app** (may be labeled as "Web app (Custom)" or "Custom Website").
   - Click **Web app** to open its configuration settings.
   - If the Web app channel isn’t enabled, click **Add channel** or **Enable** to activate it.

3. **Configure Web App Settings**:
   - In the Web app channel settings, you’ll see options to customize the channel experience.
   - **Channel URL**: Copilot Studio generates a unique URL for your agent (e.g., `https://powerva.microsoft.com/webchat?...`).
   - **Embed Code**: Below the URL, find the **Embed code** section.
     - This section provides an `<iframe>` HTML snippet to embed the agent in a web page.
     - Example embed code:
       ```html
       <iframe src="https://powerva.microsoft.com/webchat?botId=your-bot-id&..." width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
       ```
   - **Copy the Embed Code**:
     - Click the **Copy** button next to the embed code (a clipboard icon or "Copy" label).
     - Save the copied code in a text editor for the next step.
   - **Optional Settings**:
     - **Speech & DTMF**: Ensure this modality is enabled (default for a voice-enabled agent).
       - Look for a toggle or checkbox labeled "Enable Speech & DTMF" or "Voice input".
       - If not visible, it’s enabled by default since you used the Voice template.
     - **Text Input Fallback**: For the hackathon, enable text input as a backup:
       - Find the option "Allow text input" (or similar) and toggle it on.
       - This ensures users can type if voice fails (e.g., due to the microphone issue).

4. **Save Channel Settings**:
   - If you made changes (e.g., enabled text input), click **Save** (top-right of the channel settings page).

---

### 3. Create the Web App with the Embed Code
You’ll create a simple `index.html` file to embed the Copilot Studio agent, allowing browser/mobile access with voice interaction support.

1. **Navigate to the `webapp` Folder**:
   - Open your `webapp` folder (created in previous steps) in Visual Studio Code or your preferred editor.
   - If the folder doesn’t exist, create it:
     ```bash
     mkdir webapp
     cd webapp
     ```

2. **Create `index.html`**:
   - Create a new file named `index.html` in the `webapp` folder.
   - Add the following code, pasting the embed code from Copilot Studio:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
       <title>Quotation Bot Voice Demo</title>
       <style>
         body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; }
         iframe { width: 100%; height: 600px; border: none; }
       </style>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Quotation Bot Voice Demo - Hackathon 2025</h1>
       <img src="https://your-logo-url.com/logo.png" alt="Hackathon Logo" style="max-width: 100px;" />
       <!-- Paste the embed code from Copilot Studio here -->
       <!-- Example: <iframe src="https://powerva.microsoft.com/webchat?botId=your-bot-id&..." width="100%" height="600px"></iframe> -->
     </body>
     </html>
     ```
   - Replace the `<iframe>` comment with the actual embed code copied from Copilot Studio.
   - Replace `https://your-logo-url.com/logo.png` with a URL to your hackathon logo (or remove the `<img>` tag if not needed).

3. **Save the File**:
   - Save `index.html` in the `webapp` folder.

---

### 4. Serve the Web App Locally and Expose with Ngrok
You’ll use `http-server` to host the web app locally and Ngrok to make it accessible externally via HTTPS.

1. **Serve the Web App**:
   - Open a terminal in the `webapp` folder:
     ```bash
     cd webapp
     ```
   - Start `http-server` on port 8080:
     ```bash
     http-server -p 8080
     ```
   - Confirm the console shows:
     ```
     Starting up http-server, serving ./
     Available on:
       http://127.0.0.1:8080
     ```
   - Access `http://localhost:8080` in a browser to verify the web app loads (you’ll see the Copilot Studio chat widget).

2. **Expose with Ngrok**:
   - Open a new terminal (leave `http-server` running).
   - Start Ngrok to expose port 8080:
     ```bash
     ngrok http 8080
     ```
   - Ngrok will display a public HTTPS URL:
     ```
     Forwarding https://def456.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080
     ```
   - Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://def456.ngrok.io`).

---

### 5. Test the Embedded Agent with Voice Interaction
Test the web app to ensure the agent supports voice input/output and completes the conversational flow.

1. **Access the Web App**:
   - Open `https://def456.ngrok.io` in Chrome or Edge.
   - The page should display the title, logo (if added), and the Copilot Studio chat widget (a small chat window or iframe).

2. **Start the Conversation**:
   - In the chat widget, look for a microphone icon (typically at the bottom of the chat window, next to the text input field).
   - Click the microphone icon to enable voice input.
     - The browser should prompt for microphone access (e.g., "Allow this site to use your microphone?").
     - Click **Allow**.
   - Speak a trigger phrase (e.g., "start quotation").
   - The agent should respond with: "Hello! Please tell me your first name." (spoken aloud via Text-to-Speech).

3. **Complete the Conversational Flow**:
   - Speak responses (e.g., "John", "Doe", "5000", "yes").
   - Verify the agent:
     - Recognizes voice input (Speech-to-Text).
     - Responds with voice output (e.g., "Got it, John. Now, please tell me your last name.").
     - Confirms details: "Please confirm: First Name: John, Last Name: Doe, Monthly Income: $5000..."
     - Provides the mock response: "Your application has been accepted for a card. Thank you!"
     - Ends the conversation.

4. **Test on Mobile**:
   - Access `https://def456.ngrok.io` on a mobile browser (Chrome).
   - Grant microphone access (check device settings if no prompt: iOS: **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Microphone**; Android: **Settings** > **Apps** > **Chrome** > **Permissions**).
   - Test the same flow.

---

### 6. Troubleshoot the Microphone Issue
Since you’ve faced microphone issues in the previous solution, let’s ensure it works in the embedded Copilot Studio agent.

1. **Verify Microphone Prompt**:
   - When you click the microphone icon in the chat widget, ensure the browser prompts for access.
   - If no prompt appears:
     - Check browser permissions:
       - Chrome: Padlock icon > **Site settings** > **Microphone** > **Allow**.
       - Edge: Three dots > **Settings** > **Cookies and site permissions** > **Microphone** > Allow `https://def456.ngrok.io`.
     - Clear blocked permissions:
       - Chrome: `chrome://settings/content/microphone`, remove `https://def456.ngrok.io` from the "Block" list.
       - Edge: `edge://settings/content/microphone`, clear blocks.

2. **Test Microphone in Copilot Studio**:
   - Go back to Copilot Studio and open **Test your agent**.
   - Enable **Speech & DTMF** mode and test voice input.
   - If the microphone works here but not in the web app, the issue may be with the iframe or browser security.

3. **Force Microphone Access in Web App**:
   - Add a script to `index.html` to pre-request microphone access:
     ```html
     <script>
       navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })
         .then(() => console.log('Microphone access granted'))
         .catch(err => console.error('Microphone access denied:', err));
     </script>
     ```
   - Place this script just before the closing `</body>` tag.
   - Reload the page to trigger the prompt.

4. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Open the browser console (F12 > Console) while testing.
   - Look for errors related to microphone access (e.g., "NotAllowedError", "SecurityError").
   - If errors appear, share them for further troubleshooting.

5. **Fallback to Text**:
   - If the microphone still fails, use text input as a backup:
     - In the chat widget, type "start quotation" and proceed with the flow.
     - This ensures the demo can proceed even if voice fails.

### 7. Polish for Hackathon Demo
1. **Enhance UI**:
   - The `index.html` includes basic CSS for a clean look.
   - Adjust the iframe height if needed (e.g., `height: 800px` for mobile).
   - Add a background color or style:
     ```html
     <style>
       body { background-color: #f0f0f0; }
     </style>
     ```

2. **Demo Script**:
   - Open `https://def456.ngrok.io` in Chrome (laptop or mobile).
   - Start the conversation with voice (or text if voice fails).
   - Speak/type: "start quotation", "John", "Doe", "5000", "yes".
   - Highlight the conversational flow and mock response.
   - Duration: 1-2 minutes.

3. **Backup Plan**:
   - Record a video of the demo.
   - Test on multiple devices to ensure reliability.

## Additional Notes
- **No ACS Phone Number**: The web app embedding mocks telephony, relying on Copilot Studio’s voice capabilities.
- **No Certificates**: Ngrok’s HTTPS URL (`https://def456.ngrok.io`) satisfies security requirements.
- **Microphone Issue**: Copilot Studio’s managed Speech SDK should resolve the issue, but browser settings may still interfere.
- **Hackathon Appeal**: Highlight the no-code setup with Copilot Studio and voice interaction (or text fallback).

## Summary
To publish and embed the agent in a web app:
1. Publish the `QuotationBot` agent in Copilot Studio via the **Publish** menu.
2. Configure the **Web app** channel and copy the embed code.
3. Create `index.html` in the `webapp` folder, embedding the agent with the copied iframe code.
4. Serve the web app locally (`http-server -p 8080`) and expose it with Ngrok (`ngrok http 8080`).
5. Test the voice interaction flow in browser/mobile, troubleshooting the microphone issue.
6. Polish the demo for your hackathon presentation.

If the microphone issue persists, share browser console errors, and I’ll provide further assistance to ensure your hackathon demo succeeds!
