I'm glad I could help with the solutions so far! Now, let’s explore how to achieve both solutions (the real-time calling version and the mocked calling version for the hackathon demo) using **Microsoft Copilot Studio**. Copilot Studio is a low-code platform for building AI-powered conversational agents (bots) that can handle voice and text interactions, making it a good fit for the VoiceCard AI application designed for visually challenged users. It integrates seamlessly with Azure services like Azure Communication Services (ACS) for real-time calling and Azure Cognitive Services Speech SDK for voice interactions.

We’ll adapt both solutions to Copilot Studio:
- **Solution 1:** Real-time calling using ACS for actual phone calls to a toll-free number.
- **Solution 2:** Mocked calling for a hackathon demo, simulating the call flow without a real ACS subscription.

Since Copilot Studio is a visual, low-code platform, the implementation will shift from Java-based code to a conversational flow built using Copilot Studio’s designer interface. However, we’ll still need some custom integrations (e.g., for ACS, Speech Services, and the mock Quotation API) using **Power Automate flows** or **custom connectors**. I’ll provide a step-by-step guide in Markdown format for both solutions, focusing on the changes required to adapt the previous Java-based solutions to Copilot Studio.

# VoiceCard AI: Implementation Using Microsoft Copilot Studio

This document provides a step-by-step solution to implement "VoiceCard AI" using **Microsoft Copilot Studio**, a low-code platform for building conversational bots. The application is designed for visually challenged users, allowing them to generate a credit card quotation ID and handle follow-up questions via voice interaction. We’ll cover two implementations:

- **Solution 1:** Real-time calling using Azure Communication Services (ACS) to handle actual phone calls to a toll-free number.
- **Solution 2:** Mocked calling for a hackathon demo, simulating the call flow without a real ACS subscription.

Copilot Studio will replace the Java-based Spring Boot application, using its conversational flow designer to manage voice interactions. We’ll integrate with Azure services (Speech Services, ACS, etc.) using Power Automate flows and custom connectors.

## Key Features
- Voice-driven interaction for accessibility.
- Generates a quotation ID using a mock Quotation API.
- Handles follow-up questions during the conversation.
- Supports both real-time calling (Solution 1) and mocked calling (Solution 2).

## Prerequisites
- **Microsoft Copilot Studio** subscription (part of Microsoft Power Platform, available with a Microsoft 365 or Power Apps license).
- **Azure Account** with access to:
  - Azure Communication Services (ACS) for Solution 1.
  - Azure Cognitive Services Speech Service for voice interaction.
  - Azure Key Vault, Application Insights, and Azure AD B2C (optional, for best practices).
- **Power Automate** license (to create custom flows for API calls and integrations).
- **Node.js** and **npm** for the mock Quotation API.
- **PostgreSQL** for data storage (optional, if you want to persist data).
- **Azure CLI** for setting up Azure services.

## Today's Date and Time

## Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

### 1.1 Install Required Tools
- **Microsoft Copilot Studio:** Access via [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com/). Sign in with your Microsoft 365 account.
- **Power Automate:** Access via [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com/). Ensure you have a license to create flows.
- **Node.js and npm:** Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Verify: `node -v` and `npm -v`.
- **PostgreSQL (Optional):** Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). Set a password (e.g., `your-postgres-password`). Create a database:
  ```bash
  psql -U postgres
  CREATE DATABASE creditcard_db;
  \q
  ```
- **Azure CLI:** Install from [learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Verify: `az --version`.

### 1.2 Set Up the Mock Quotation API
Create a mock API for generating quotation IDs (same as in previous solutions):

In `mock-creditcard-api/server.js`:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/api/creditcard/apply', (req, res) => {
    const { name, income, phone } = req.body;
    const quotationId = `QUOT-${Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 8)}`;
    res.json({ name, phone, quotationId });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Mock Quotation API running on port 3000'));
```

To set up:
1. Create a directory: `mock-creditcard-api`.
2. Initialize a Node.js project:
   ```bash
   cd mock-creditcard-api
   npm init -y
   npm install express
   ```
3. Save the code as `server.js`.
4. Start the API:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

---

## Step 2: Set Up Azure Services Using Azure CLI

### 2.1 Create an Azure Account
- Sign up for a free Azure account at [azure.com](https://azure.com) ($200 credit for 30 days).
- Log in via the CLI:
  ```bash
  az login
  ```

### 2.2 Set Up a Resource Group
Create a resource group named `voicecard-rg` in the East US region:
```bash
az group create --name voicecard-rg --location eastus
```

### 2.3 Create a Speech Service (For Both Solutions)
1. Create a Speech Service resource:
   ```bash
   az cognitiveservices account create \
       --name voicecard-speech \
       --kind SpeechServices \
       --sku F0 \
       --location eastus \
       --resource-group voicecard-rg
   ```
2. Retrieve the Speech Service key and region:
   ```bash
   az cognitiveservices account keys list --name voicecard-speech --resource-group voicecard-rg --query key1 --output tsv
   ```
   Example: `your-speech-key`
   ```bash
   az cognitiveservices account show --name voicecard-speech --resource-group voicecard-rg --query location --output tsv
   ```
   Example: `eastus`

### 2.4 Create a Key Vault
Create a Key Vault to store secrets:
```bash
az keyvault create --name voicecard-vault --resource-group voicecard-rg --location eastus
```
- Store the Speech Service key:
  ```bash
  az keyvault secret set --vault-name voicecard-vault --name speech-key --value "your-speech-key"
  ```
- Note the Key Vault URI:
  ```bash
  az keyvault show --name voicecard-vault --resource-group voicecard-rg --query properties.vaultUri --output tsv
  ```
  Example: `https://voicecard-vault.vault.azure.net/`

### 2.5 Set Up Azure Active Directory B2C (Optional)
1. Create an Azure AD B2C tenant:
   ```bash
   az ad app create --display-name VoiceCardB2C
   az ad sp create --id <application-id-from-previous-command>
   az tenant create --display-name VoiceCardB2C --domain-name voicecardb2c --country-code US
   ```
   Note the tenant ID.

2. Switch to the B2C tenant:
   ```bash
   az login --tenant voicecardb2c.onmicrosoft.com
   ```

3. Register an application:
   ```bash
   az ad app create --display-name voicecard-app --reply-urls http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/azure
   ```
   Note the **Application (client) ID** and **Client Secret**.

### 2.6 Create an Application Insights Resource (Optional)
```bash
az monitor app-insights component create --app voicecard-insights --location eastus --resource-group voicecard-rg
```
- Note the Instrumentation Key:
  ```bash
  az monitor app-insights component show --app voicecard-insights --resource-group voicecard-rg --query instrumentationKey --output tsv
  ```
  Example: `your-instrumentation-key`

### 2.7 Set Up Azure Communication Services (For Solution 1 Only)
If you’re implementing Solution 1 (real-time calling), set up ACS:
1. Create an ACS resource:
   ```bash
   az communication create --name voicecard-acs --location global --data-location unitedstates --resource-group voicecard-rg
   ```
   - Note the connection string:
     ```bash
     az communication list --resource-group voicecard-rg --query "[0].connectionString" --output tsv
     ```
     Example: `endpoint=https://voicecard-acs.communication.azure.com/;accesskey=your-acs-key`
2. Acquire a toll-free number:
   ```bash
   az communication phonenumber list-available --location US --type tollfree --assignment-type application --capabilities calling=inbound sms=inbound-outbound --quantity 1 --resource-group voicecard-rg --connection-string "endpoint=https://voicecard-acs.communication.azure.com/;accesskey=your-acs-key"
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   Search id: search-123
   Reserved phone numbers:
   +18001234567
   ```
   Purchase the number:
   ```bash
   az communication phonenumber purchase --search-id search-123 --resource-group voicecard-rg --connection-string "endpoint=https://voicecard-acs.communication.azure.com/;accesskey=your-acs-key"
   ```
3. Store the ACS connection string in Key Vault:
   ```bash
   az keyvault secret set --vault-name voicecard-vault --name acs-connection-string --value "endpoint=https://voicecard-acs.communication.azure.com/;accesskey=your-acs-key"
   ```

---

## Step 3: Create a Copilot in Copilot Studio

### 3.1 Access Copilot Studio
1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com/) and sign in.
2. On the left sidebar, select **Copilots**.
3. Click **+ New copilot** to create a new copilot named `VoiceCardAI`.

### 3.2 Configure Copilot Settings
1. **Name:** `VoiceCardAI`.
2. **Language:** English (or your preferred language).
3. **Voice Channel:** Enable the voice channel for voice interactions:
   - Go to **Settings > Channels**.
   - Enable **Voice** and configure it to use Azure Speech Services:
     - Speech Service Key: `your-speech-key`.
     - Region: `eastus`.
4. **Authentication (Optional):** If using Azure AD B2C, configure authentication:
   - Go to **Settings > Authentication**.
   - Select **Manual (for custom provider)**.
   - Configure with your Azure AD B2C tenant details (client ID, client secret, etc.).

---

## Step 4: Implement Solution 1 - Real-Time Calling with ACS

### 4.1 Configure ACS Integration in Copilot Studio
Copilot Studio supports voice calling via ACS, but you’ll need to set up a webhook to handle incoming calls and integrate ACS with Copilot Studio.

1. **Set Up ACS Webhook:**
   - In Copilot Studio, go to **Settings > Channels > Voice**.
   - Note the webhook URL provided for incoming calls (e.g., `https://your-copilot-webhook-url`).
   - Configure ACS to send events to this webhook:
     ```bash
     az communication update \
         --name voicecard-acs \
         --event-subscription-url "https://your-copilot-webhook-url" \
         --resource-group voicecard-rg
     ```

2. **Create a Power Automate Flow for ACS Integration:**
   - Go to [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com/) and create a new flow named `HandleACSCall`.
   - **Trigger:** HTTP Request (to receive ACS events).
     - Use the schema of an ACS incoming call event (you can find this in ACS documentation).
   - **Action:** Call Copilot Studio to trigger a conversation:
     - Add an action: **Microsoft Copilot Studio > Trigger a conversation**.
     - Select your `VoiceCardAI` copilot.
     - Pass the caller’s phone number (from the ACS event) as a variable.
   - Save the flow and note the HTTP endpoint URL (e.g., `https://your-power-automate-flow-url`).
   - Update the ACS webhook to point to this flow URL instead of the Copilot Studio webhook directly.

### 4.2 Create the Conversational Flow in Copilot Studio
1. **Create a Topic: `HandleIncomingCall`**
   - Go to **Topics** in Copilot Studio.
   - Create a new topic named `HandleIncomingCall`.
   - **Trigger Phrases:** Add a trigger like "Incoming call" (this will be triggered programmatically via Power Automate).
   - **Variables:**
     - `callerPhoneNumber` (Text): To store the caller’s phone number.
     - `userName` (Text): To store the user’s name.
     - `phoneNumber` (Text): To store the user’s provided phone number.
     - `income` (Number): To store the user’s income.
     - `quotationId` (Text): To store the generated quotation ID.
     - `followUpQuestion` (Text): To store the follow-up question (if any).

2. **Add Nodes to the Topic:**
   - **Message Node:** "Welcome to VoiceCard AI. This is an automated system to help you generate a credit card quotation ID. Please say your name."
   - **Question Node:** Ask for the user’s name (voice input).
     - Save the response to `userName`.
   - **Message Node:** "Please say your phone number, one digit at a time, for example, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0."
   - **Question Node:** Ask for the phone number (voice input).
     - Save the response to `phoneNumber`.
     - Add a condition to clean the input (e.g., remove non-digits using a Power Fx expression like `Substitute(phoneNumber, "[^0-9]", "")`).
   - **Message Node:** "Please say your annual income in dollars, for example, 50 thousand."
   - **Question Node:** Ask for the income (voice input).
     - Save the response to `income`.
     - Add a condition to parse the income (e.g., handle "50 thousand" using a Power Fx expression like `If(Contains(income, "thousand"), Value(Substitute(income, "thousand", "")) * 1000, Value(income))`).

3. **Call the Quotation API Using Power Automate:**
   - Create a Power Automate flow named `CallQuotationAPI`:
     - **Trigger:** PowerApps (to be called from Copilot Studio).
     - **Action:** HTTP - Make a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/api/creditcard/apply`.
       - Body: `{ "name": "@{triggerBody()['name']}", "phone": "@{triggerBody()['phone']}", "income": "@{triggerBody()['income']}" }`.
     - **Action:** Parse JSON to extract the `quotationId`.
     - **Action:** Respond to PowerApps with the `quotationId`.
   - In Copilot Studio, add an **Action** node to call this flow:
     - Pass `userName`, `phoneNumber`, and `income` as inputs.
     - Save the output (`quotationId`) to the `quotationId` variable.

4. **Save to Database (Optional):**
   - Create a Power Automate flow named `SaveToDatabase`:
     - **Trigger:** PowerApps.
     - **Action:** SQL Server - Insert row (if using PostgreSQL, use a custom connector or API to insert into the database).
       - Table: `application`.
       - Columns: `name`, `phone`, `income`, `decision` (map to `userName`, `phoneNumber`, `income`, `quotationId`).
   - Add an **Action** node in Copilot Studio to call this flow.

5. **Inform the User of the Quotation ID:**
   - **Message Node:** "Thank you, [userName]. Your credit card quotation ID is [quotationId]. Please note this down."

6. **Handle Follow-Up Questions:**
   - **Question Node:** "Do you have any follow-up questions about your quotation? Please say yes or no."
     - Save the response to a temporary variable (e.g., `hasFollowUp`).
   - **Condition Node:** If `hasFollowUp` contains "yes":
     - **Question Node:** "Please state your question."
       - Save the response to `followUpQuestion`.
     - **Message Node:** "Thank you for your question: [followUpQuestion]. A customer care representative will follow up with you soon."
   - **Message Node:** "Thank you for using VoiceCard AI. Goodbye!"

### 4.3 Test Solution 1
1. **Publish the Copilot:**
   - Click **Publish** in Copilot Studio to deploy the copilot.
2. **Call the Toll-Free Number:**
   - Dial the toll-free number (`+18001234567`) acquired in Step 2.7.
   - The ACS webhook will trigger the Power Automate flow (`HandleACSCall`), which will start the `HandleIncomingCall` topic in Copilot Studio.
   - Follow the voice prompts to provide your name, phone number, income, and follow-up questions.
   - The copilot will generate a quotation ID and end the call.

---

## Step 5: Implement Solution 2 - Mocked Calling for Hackathon Demo

### 5.1 Remove ACS Dependency
Since Solution 2 mocks the calling functionality, we don’t need ACS. We’ll simulate the call flow within Copilot Studio using a web-based trigger.

### 5.2 Create a Demo Topic in Copilot Studio
1. **Create a Topic: `SimulateIncomingCall`**
   - Go to **Topics** in Copilot Studio.
   - Create a new topic named `SimulateIncomingCall`.
   - **Trigger Phrases:** Add a trigger like "Start demo" (or trigger programmatically via a web endpoint).
   - **Variables:** Reuse the same variables as in Solution 1 (`callerPhoneNumber`, `userName`, `phoneNumber`, `income`, `quotationId`, `followUpQuestion`).

2. **Add Nodes to Simulate the Call:**
   - **Message Node:** "[MockCallingService] Simulating incoming call from +18001234567..."
   - **Message Node:** "[MockCallingService] Call accepted. Call is now active."
   - Reuse the same flow as in Solution 1 (`HandleIncomingCall` topic):
     - **Message Node:** "Welcome to VoiceCard AI. This is an automated system to help you generate a credit card quotation ID. Please say your name."
     - **Question Node:** Ask for the user’s name (voice input).
       - Save the response to `userName`.
     - **Message Node:** "Please say your phone number, one digit at a time, for example, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0."
     - **Question Node:** Ask for the phone number (voice input).
       - Save the response to `phoneNumber`.
       - Clean the input using Power Fx.
     - **Message Node:** "Please say your annual income in dollars, for example, 50 thousand."
     - **Question Node:** Ask for the income (voice input).
       - Save the response to `income`.
       - Parse the income using Power Fx.
     - Call the `CallQuotationAPI` flow to generate the quotation ID.
     - Save to the database (optional) using the `SaveToDatabase` flow.
     - **Message Node:** "Thank you, [userName]. Your credit card quotation ID is [quotationId]. Please note this down."
     - **Question Node:** "Do you have any follow-up questions about your quotation? Please say yes or no."
       - Save the response to `hasFollowUp`.
     - **Condition Node:** If `hasFollowUp` contains "yes":
       - **Question Node:** "Please state your question."
         - Save the response to `followUpQuestion`.
       - **Message Node:** "Thank you for your question: [followUpQuestion]. A customer care representative will follow up with you soon."
     - **Message Node:** "Thank you for using VoiceCard AI. Goodbye!"
     - **Message Node:** "[MockCallingService] Simulating call hang-up..."

### 5.3 Create a Web Endpoint to Trigger the Demo
1. **Create a Power Automate Flow: `TriggerDemo`**
   - **Trigger:** HTTP Request (to trigger the demo via a web endpoint).
   - **Action:** Microsoft Copilot Studio - Trigger a conversation.
     - Select the `VoiceCardAI` copilot.
     - Trigger the `SimulateIncomingCall` topic.
   - Save the flow and note the HTTP endpoint URL (e.g., `https://your-demo-flow-url`).

2. **Create a Simple Web Page to Start the Demo:**
   - In Copilot Studio, go to **Settings > Channels > Custom Website**.
   - Add a custom website channel and note the embed code.
   - Alternatively, create a simple HTML page to trigger the demo:
     In `demo.html`:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
         <title>VoiceCard AI Demo</title>
     </head>
     <body>
         <h1>VoiceCard AI Hackathon Demo</h1>
         <button onclick="startDemo()">Start Demo</button>
         <script>
             async function startDemo() {
                 await fetch('https://your-demo-flow-url', {
                     method: 'POST',
                     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
                     body: JSON.stringify({})
                 });
                 alert('Demo started. Follow the voice prompts.');
             }
         </script>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```
   - Host this page locally using a simple server (e.g., `npx http-server`) or deploy it to a static hosting service.

### 5.4 Test Solution 2
1. **Publish the Copilot:**
   - Click **Publish** in Copilot Studio.
2. **Run the Demo:**
   - Open `demo.html` in a browser.
   - Click the "Start Demo" button.
   - The `SimulateIncomingCall` topic will start, and you’ll hear voice prompts (e.g., "Welcome to VoiceCard AI... Please say your name.").
   - Respond via voice to provide your name, phone number, income, and follow-up questions.
   - Console logs in Copilot Studio will show the simulated call flow (e.g., "[MockCallingService] Simulating incoming call from +18001234567...").
   - The demo will end with a goodbye message and a simulated hang-up.

## Step 6: Changes Required to Adapt Java Solution to Copilot Studio

### 6.1 Architectural Changes
- **Java Application Replaced:** The Spring Boot application (Java 21) is replaced by Copilot Studio’s conversational flow.
- **Voice Interaction:** Instead of using the Azure Speech SDK directly in Java, Copilot Studio’s built-in voice channel (backed by Azure Speech Services) handles speech-to-text and text-to-speech.
- **Calling Service:**
  - **Solution 1:** ACS integration is managed via Copilot Studio’s voice channel and Power Automate flows.
  - **Solution 2:** The `MockCallingService` is replaced by simulated messages within the `SimulateIncomingCall` topic.
- **Quotation API and Database:** These are still called via Power Automate flows, similar to the HTTP and SQL actions in the Java solution.
- **Security:** Azure AD B2C authentication is configured directly in Copilot Studio’s settings, replacing Spring Security.

### 6.2 Code Changes
- **Removed Java Code:** All Java files (`VoiceCardAiApplication.java`, `ApplicationService.java`, etc.) are no longer needed.
- **Power Automate Flows:** Replace Java service logic with flows:
  - `CallQuotationAPI` flow replaces the Java `QuotationService`.
  - `SaveToDatabase` flow replaces the Java database integration.
  - `HandleACSCall` (Solution 1) and `TriggerDemo` (Solution 2) flows replace the Java controllers.
- **Conversational Flow:** The logic in `ApplicationService.java` (e.g., prompting for name, phone, income) is now implemented as a topic in Copilot Studio.

### 6.3 Deployment Changes
- **No Spring Boot Deployment:** Instead of running a Spring Boot app (`mvn spring-boot:run`), you publish the copilot in Copilot Studio.
- **Web Endpoint for Demo:** Solution 2 uses a web-based trigger (`demo.html`) instead of a Java controller (`DemoController.java`).

---

## Step 7: Prepare for Hackathon Presentation (Solution 2)

### 7.1 Demonstrate the Flow
- Open `demo.html` in a browser.
- Click "Start Demo" to trigger the `SimulateIncomingCall` topic.
- Use a microphone to respond to voice prompts (name, phone number, income, follow-up questions).
- Show the Copilot Studio logs to highlight the simulated call flow (e.g., "[MockCallingService] Simulating incoming call...").
- Display the database entries (if implemented) to confirm the quotation ID was saved.

### 7.2 Explain the Mocked Calling
- Mention that real-time calling with ACS was mocked for the demo due to subscription constraints.
- Highlight that the voice interaction (via Copilot Studio’s voice channel) and backend logic (quotation generation, database storage) are fully functional.
- If judges ask about real calling, explain that Solution 1 integrates ACS, as shown in Step 4.

---

## Accessibility Considerations

- **Voice-Only Interaction:** Copilot Studio’s voice channel ensures a seamless voice-driven experience, with clear prompts for visually challenged users.
- **Error Handling:** Input parsing (e.g., for phone numbers and income) is handled using Power Fx expressions in Copilot Studio.
- **Follow-Up Support:** Follow-up questions are logged for later action by a representative.

---

## Summary

- Implemented VoiceCard AI using Microsoft Copilot Studio, replacing the Java-based solution with a low-code conversational flow.
- **Solution 1:** Integrated ACS for real-time calling to a toll-free number, using Power Automate to handle incoming call events.
- **Solution 2:** Mocked the calling functionality for a hackathon demo, simulating the call flow within Copilot Studio.
- Used Azure Speech Services (via Copilot Studio’s voice channel) for voice interaction.
- Integrated with a mock Quotation API and database using Power Automate flows.
- Ensured accessibility with voice-only prompts and error handling.

This solution is now fully tailored for both real-time calling and a hackathon demo, leveraging Copilot Studio’s low-code capabilities.
```

---

### **Key Benefits of Using Copilot Studio**

- **Low-Code Development:** Eliminates the need for Java coding, making it faster to develop and iterate during a hackathon.
- **Built-In Voice Support:** Copilot Studio’s voice channel simplifies voice interaction, replacing the need for direct integration with the Azure Speech SDK.
- **Scalability:** Easily integrates with ACS (Solution 1) or supports a mocked demo (Solution 2) without changing the core conversational flow.
- **Accessibility:** The voice-driven flow is inherently accessible, with Copilot Studio handling speech-to-text and text-to-speech seamlessly.
